 * John Lambert
 * Convex Hull
 * October 6, 2015
 * I implement an algorithm that can find the "Convex hull" given a set
 * of points (fed in as x,y coordinates).
 *
 * Algorithmic time complexity will be O(n log(n)) because we do O(1) work
 * for n points, and we repeat this work at log(n) levels.  Furthermore,
 * sorting also adds O(n log(n)).
 * 
 * I use the sorting function from C#'s library called "Array.Sort" to sort
 * my list of points in terms of increasing x-values.  Microsoft states
 * that their library function uses different algorithms depending on
 * specific criteria: "If the partition size is fewer than 16 elements, it
 * uses an insertion sort algorithm.  If the number of partitions exceeds
 * 2 * LogN, where N is the range of the input array, it uses a Heapsort
 * algorithm. Otherwise, it uses a Quicksort algorithm."
 *
 * Yes, we know that Quicksort has worst-case scenario of O(n^2) sorting,
 * and that insertion sort has average case O(n^2). But we are working with
 * numbers on the scale of 100-1000, not less than 16. So we can assume we
 * avoid this insertion sort complexity. Generally, we will be working with
 * Quicksort, which has average-case complexity of O(n*log(n)), so we can
 * safely say that this is the time complexity added by sorting the points.
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY OF EACH PORTION OF MY ALGORITHM
 * Divide list in half  - O(N), look at each point once
 * Recurse left
 * Recurse right
 * Sort lists into counter-clockwise order O(N) - we look at each point once
 * Find Upper Tangent - O(N) because we look at basically 1/2 * n points
 *      (upper 1/2)
 * Find Lower Tangent - O(N) because we look at basically 1/2 * n points
 *      (lower 1/2)
 * Combining/ merging the hulls is also O(N) 
 *
 * Space complexity is O(N) since I just have a bunch of lists with n
 * elements in them, where n is the number of original points specified.
 *
 * The following recurrence relation describes the algorithm: 
 * T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n), where T(n) represents  the number of operations
 * required as a function of the original number of n points specified. 
 * O(n) is the complexity to combine two hulls. The size of the subtask
 * is 1/2 the number of points of its parent, and each split creates two
 * subtasks. By the Master Theorem, when we consider the equation
 * T(n) = at( n/b) + O(n^d), we see in our case that d=1 and that b = 2,
 * a = 2. Thus a/(b^d) = 2/2 = 1, so the work is constant at each level
 * of the divide and conquer algorithm. The Master Theorem once again
 * proves that the time complexity of the recurrence relation 
 * is O( (n^1) * log(n) ).
 *
 * At first the problem seems trivial, because it seemes as if one could
 * always use the greatest and least y vals for upper tangent. This is not
 * the case (have to traverse set of points clockwise or counterclockwise
 * and compare slopes to know for certain ).
