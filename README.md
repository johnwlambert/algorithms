Much of the code I have posted on other Designer.cs forms and some other mundane C# setup code. I have included only the code that illustrates the algorithm. If you'd like to run the algorithms on your local machine, ping me at 'johnwl AT stanford.edu' and I will send you the rest of the C# setup code.
